Linguagens e frameworks

### Python 3

Python 3 introduced many useful features that are not backward compatible with Python 2.x. It also removed numerous Python 2.x features that were maintained for backward compatibility, making Python 3 easier to learn and use and more consistent with the rest of the language. Our experience using Python 3 in domains such as machine learning and web application development shows that both the language and most of its supporting libraries have matured for adoption. We were able to fork and patch minor issues of existing libraries or avoided using incompatible Python 2.x libraries that had been abandoned. If you are developing in Python we strongly encourage you to use Python 3.


### Ruby

Criada em 93, Ruby é um linguagem de programação interpretada e totalmente orientada a objetos que possui enorme expressividade. Uma linguagem muito simples de ler e ser entendida, facilitando assim o desenvolvimento e a manutenção de programas.

#### _"Ruby is simple in appearance, but is very complex inside, just like our human body"_
##### - Yukihiro Matsumoto, Criador do Ruby

A linguagem foi adotada pelo LAPPIS por proporcionar um curto período de adaptação por novos membros, sem restringir a capacidade de desenvolvimento de aplicações complexas por membros mais experientes.

### Vue.js

In the ever-changing world of front-end JavaScript frameworks, one of the emerging favorites appears to be Vue.js. Vue.js is a lightweight alternative to AngularJS. It is designed to be a very flexible—and a less opinionated—library that offers a set of tools for building interactive web interfaces around concepts such as modularity, components and reactive data flow. It has a low learning curve, which makes it interesting for less experienced developers and beginners. Note, though, that Vue.js is not a full-blown framework; it is focused on the view layer only and therefore is easy to integrate with other libraries or existing projects.
